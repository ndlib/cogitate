Welcome to the Cogitate gem.

If you are looking at the code repository this gem may look a little unusual.
It is embedded inside a Rails application (Cogitate).

The goal is that the initial development shares many concerns, so I don't want to separate Client and Server side responsibilities.

**Note:** Any files in the lib/cogitate directory will be included in the cogitate gem.
